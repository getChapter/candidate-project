# 🧑‍💻Chapter Engineering Candidate Project

Congrats on making it to the project stage of Chapter's hiring process! With this project, we'd like to see how well you can build full stack applications and test your ability to work with complicated data.

## The Basics

You're tasked with building a simple website that allows users to search Medicare plans.

Don't spend more than 4 hours on this project.

Remember - you're building an MVP, so prioritize functionality over performance. Worry less about performance and more about building a complete, functional web app.

## Important Terms

Health insurance is filled with dozens of confusing terms - here are a few that should help you out with this project.

- Premium: the amount that you pay every month for the Medicare plan.
- Bid ID: A unique identifier for Medicare Advantage plans. Of the form "Hxxx-xxx-xxx".

## Data Files

We've included 2 data files and 1 data dictionary to base your work off of. We've intentionally left the files as they are exported from CMS, the government agency that consolidates Medicare data. As a result, you may find these files convoluted - that's okay! Don't hesitate to reach out if you run into issues. All files are TSVs.

- `pbp_Section_A.txt` - Contains basic information about Medicare plans.
- `pbp_Section_D.txt` - Contains more in-depth information about Medicare plans.
- `pbp_Benefits_2021_dictionary.txt` - A dictionary lookup for the column headers in the section A and section D files.
